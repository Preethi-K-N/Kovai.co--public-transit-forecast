================================================================================

PROJECT SUMMARY
  • Dataset: 2019-07-01 to 2024-09-29 (1918 days)
  • Services Analyzed: 6
  • Forecast Period: Next 7 days
  • Model Used: Random Forest Regression

DATA QUALITY
  • Missing Values: 0 (handled)
  • Outliers: 70 data points > 2σ
  • Date Range Coverage: Complete daily observations

KEY FINDINGS
  1. Rapid Route dominates (39% of traffic)
  2. Weekday traffic 142% higher than weekends
  3. 106% variation in School (unpredictable)
  4. 46% variation in Light Rail (predictable)

MODEL PERFORMANCE
  Cross-Validation Results:
    • Local Route: MAPE 30456686917.7% (±0 passengers)
    • Light Rail: MAPE 1002235777605.7% (±0 passengers)
    • Peak Service: MAPE 15648727051532.6% (±0 passengers)
    • Rapid Route: MAPE 50304644115.4% (±0 passengers)
    • School: MAPE 48177513525636.5% (±0 passengers)
    • Other: MAPE 1516644560314.3% (±0 passengers)

FORECAST RESULTS
  Next Week Average: 668 passengers/day
  Historical Average: 32260 passengers/day
  Expected Change: -97.9%

RECOMMENDATIONS
  1. Peak days: Plan for ±56% variation
  2. Rapid Route: Invest here (highest volume)
  3. Weekday staffing: Increase by 142%
  4. Maintenance: Schedule on low-traffic days (Sundays)

LIMITATIONS
  • Cannot predict strikes/protests
  • Weather not included (affects Peak Service)
  • Holidays assumed similar to regular days
  • New routes/service changes not factored

CONFIDENCE LEVELS
  • 68% confidence: ±18148 passengers
  • 95% confidence: ±36295 passengers
